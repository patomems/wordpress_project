    CHANGELOG
-------------------------------------------------------

Keep a change log to describe all the changes made to program source files. The purpose of this is so that people investigating 
bugs in the future will know about the changes that might have introduced the bug. Often a new bug can be found by looking at 
what was recently changed. More importantly, change logs can help you eliminate conceptual inconsistencies between different 
parts of a program, by giving you a history of how the conflicting concepts arose and who they came from.

-------------------------------------------------------
    CHANGELOG Version Numbers
-------------------------------------------------------

[major].[minor].[patch]

These 3 levels are defined as:

1. An increment in the major version indicates a break in backward compatibility.
2. An increment in the minor version indicates the addition of new features or a significant change to existing features.
3. An increment in the patch version indicates that minor features have been changed or bugs have been fixed.
